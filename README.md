## My process
  
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm still struggling with mobile-first design, but I think I've made some progress in that area. Also, I think the way I code in general is getting better because of these challenges.

### Continued development

I found the mobile-first worflow to be really less painful to follow than the desktop first approach, so I'l really utilize this methodology in the future.
